# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Performance
Machine Learning

**Overview
This Jupyter notebook (Prathyusha_solution.ipynb) analyzes HR employee attrition data and builds predictive models to identify potential attrition cases. The dataset used in this analysis is WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv.
**
## Usage
1. Dataset: Ensure that the dataset file WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv is available in the specified file path /content/drive/MyDrive/.
2. Environment Setup: Run the notebook in a Python environment that supports Jupyter notebooks. Ensure all necessary libraries are installed, including numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, and xgboost.
3. Execution: Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, visualize correlations, and build predictive models.

### Key Steps
### Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the dataset and perform basic preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

### Correlation Analysis: Visualize the correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.

### Model Building: Train logistic regression models with L2 regularization, SVM with RBF kernel, and random forest classifier. SMOTE oversampling technique is applied to address class imbalance.

### Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
